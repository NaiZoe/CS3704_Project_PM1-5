Project description:
Bonus Buddy is a gamification-based workplace productivity system targeting software engineers by assimilating game-like features into their daily workflow. On an even larger scale, compared with traditional reward systems featuring deferred incentives such as year-end bonuses, this solution presents immediate, incremental incentives and rewards for task accomplishment based on performance. Tracking and showing tasks in real-time, as well as dynamic leader boards and achievements, aim to motivate employees to encourage the best performance. Breaking projects into much smaller milestones by rewarding each tiny step of progress helps employees feel and visualize their achievement, getting momentum and reducing procrastination. This is built on top of an event-driven architecture coupled with an intuitive UI and integrates well with Jira, Slack, and GitHub, thus allowing Bonus Buddy to fit easily within users' existing workflows, motivating alignment between personal goals and corporate goals.
